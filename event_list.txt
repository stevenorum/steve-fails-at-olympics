Which ones are feasible for me to do?
-Diving, if just for the video of me failing
-Individual swimming for sure, although not 10km
-Possibly canoe/kayak, but I need to see exactly what it entails
-BMX, if just for the video of me failing
-Mountain biking, if I can track down a mountain bike
-Road cycling
-Gymnastics, if just for the video of me failing
-Archery
-Most "Athletics" events
-Rowing, if I can find a scull to use
-Sailing, if I can find a one-person sailboat to use.  Would be tough to match the conditions, though.
-Shooting
-Triathlon
-Weightlifting
